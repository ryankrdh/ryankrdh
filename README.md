Welcome!

About me:
I am a developer with a background in healthcare, where I excelled as a provider and successfully led hygiene programs that doubled revenues for dental offices. However, I felt a strong urge to explore my passion for problem-solving, which led me to discover programming. With every coding challenge I conquered, my love for software engineering grew, and I knew I had found my true calling.

In addition to my technical expertise in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I possess exceptional leadership skills. I have led team meetings and provided mentorship to fellow developers. My ability to solve problems effectively and communicate with clients has resulted in outstanding customer service.

I am dedicated to delivering high-quality software solutions and contributing to the ever-evolving world of technology. If given the opportunity, I am confident that I can make a significant impact on your software engineering projects and contribute to the success of your team. Thank you for considering my application.
