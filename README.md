I am a software developer with a healthcare background, where I excelled as a provider and successfully led programs that doubled revenues for dental offices. However, my experience also revealed that many dental offices continue to rely on outdated software lacking modern conveniences for patients, such as online appointment scheduling and reminder systems. To address this issue and enhance patient care, I embarked on creating a web application that streamlines the process, making it easier for my patients to achieve their dental health goals.

Through this journey, I discovered the immense potential of technology to create a positive impact on a wider scale. Now, I am committed to leveraging my skills in software development to make a difference in the community. My passion lies in delivering user-friendly web applications that effectively tackle the challenges posed by modern problems.
