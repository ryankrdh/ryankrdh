About me: 
I've been working in the dental field for about 9 years. I mainly work 
with patients that have severe dental anxiety. I've built and maintained an accelerated hygiene 
program for couple dental offices doubling their hygiene revenue. During the pandemic I learned some 
basic programming and created a choice driven story game for kids and fell in love with programming. 
I've been learning and improving my skills every night after work in the hopes of meeting 
others just as passionate about creating programs that can put a smile on peoples' faces.
